there are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. 

booleans are a subtype of integers.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">bool:</span>**

this type represents True or False.

**bool parameters are as follows:**

• x = an optional value to test for truth. False values include: None, False, zero, empty strings, empty sequences, and empty collections. true values include: True, one, and anything else that isn't empty. if x is not specified, the bool function will return False.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">int:</span>**

this type represents an integer.

**int parameters are as follows:**

• x = an optional value to convert to an integer.

if x is not specified, the int function will return zero.

• base = an optional x-dependent value to select which base x will be represented in. bases can range from 2 to 36. 

if a base is specified, then x must be a string.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">float:</span>**

this type represents a floating point value.

**float parameters are as follows:**

• x = an optional value to convert to a float.

if x is not specified, the float function will return 0.0.

**float functions are as follows:**

• is_integer(), which returns True if the float is a whole number, and returns False otherwise.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">complex:</span>**

the gist: this type represents a number which is made up of a real and an imaginary component.
